What happens when a visitor clicks a link to an external site? They just leave?? Then know that youre leaving money on the table, losing potential customers, and wasting possible social bookmarks.<br />

Wordpress Exit strategy is a plugin to redirect all external links in your posts through an exit page. Your exit page design and contents is what sets your exit strategy. Place ads, social bookmarking buttons, and links. You can include the outgoing link in your exit page, and auto redirect to it.<br />

Still dont see why you need a Wordpress Exit Strategy?<br />
1.	Monetize outgoing links with ads on your exit page. Or offer them for rent on your favorite ads market.<br />
2.	Get more social bookmarks. Place your social bookmarking links on your exit page. Gain an extra stream for social interaction.<br />
3.	Protect your SEO score! Linking directly to external websites will leak some of your SEO points to the Linked page. Wordpress Exit Strategy will protect you from this with its “nofollow” links.<br />
4.	Offer alternative contents or websites, and you may bounce you visitor back into your website.<br />
